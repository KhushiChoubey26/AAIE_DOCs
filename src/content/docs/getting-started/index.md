# Welcome to AAIE

**Artificial Assessment Intelligence for Educators (AAIE)** is a cutting-edge project that develops domain-specific Large Language Models for educational assessment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

AAIE addresses the critical challenge of maintaining academic integrity and providing quality feedback in the age of generative AI. Our solution includes:

- **AI Detection Model**: Identifies AI-generated content with high accuracy
- **Feedback Generation Model**: Creates rubric-aligned feedback for students
- **Educational Integration**: Seamless deployment to CloudDeakin and OnTrack

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Domain-specific models trained on educational content
- High accuracy with low false positive rates
- Real-time API endpoints for integration
- Ethical AI practices with bias detection
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
